<h3>TASK 01</h3>
<P>This C++ program, titled "Number Guessing Game," is an interactive console-based game designed to test your guessing skills. The program offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, along with an option to exit the game.

**Key Features:**

1. **Random Number Generation:** The program utilizes the `rand()` function along with the `srand(time(0))` to generate random numbers, ensuring unpredictability.

2. **Difficulty Levels:**
   - **Easy:** In this mode, the program randomly selects a number between 0 and 10, and the player has 10 attempts to guess it.
   - **Medium:** In this mode, the player can set the maximum and minimum range for the random number, with a limit on the difference between these values. The player then has a limited number of attempts to guess the number.
   - **Hard:** Similar to the Medium mode but with a larger range and more attempts.

3. **Input Validation:** The program incorporates input validation to ensure that the user enters valid ranges and follows the rules for each difficulty level.

4. **User Interaction:** The game provides a user-friendly interface with clear instructions, countdown of remaining attempts, and prompts for guesses.

5. **Win or Lose:** After each game, the program informs the player whether they have successfully guessed the number or lost the game.

6. **Continuous Play:** The game can be played repeatedly, allowing the user to choose different difficulty levels or exit the program.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Choose the desired difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
2. Follow the prompts to set the range (for Medium and Hard) and make your guesses.
3. Try to guess the randomly generated number within the given attempts.
4. Receive feedback on whether you've won or lost the game.
5. Repeat the game or exit as desired.

This program serves as an engaging exercise to practice C++ programming skills and logic while having fun with a classic guessing game. Enjoy your time playing and learning!

<h3>TASK 02</h3>
<P>Welcome to the CODSOFT repository! This task houses a C++ program for a command-line calculator. This calculator program is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.

**Key Features:**
- **User Interaction:** The program engages users in an interactive manner, allowing them to input two numbers and choose their desired arithmetic operation.
- **Error Handling:** It includes error handling for division by zero, ensuring safe calculations.
- **Menu System:** The program presents a menu system for easy operation selection.
- **Clean Code:** The code is well-structured, neatly organized, and thoroughly documented for clarity and understanding.

This calculator program serves as an educational project, demonstrating core C++ concepts, including classes, operator overloading, conditional statements, and user input handling.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or use it as a reference for learning C++ programming and building interactive command-line applications.
